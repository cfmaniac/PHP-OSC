NOTES ON THIS CONTRIBUTION:
The Task Manager Contribution was created out of a need to ascertain the status of many tasks needed to be done in-store through the oscommerce admin.

I've tried to keep as much as the code contained within the files as possible, as to ensure that 
installing and using the Task Manager Contribution was as easy as Possible.

NOTE: When Adding a Project, the Project Name needs to be 3 Characters or More. 

You may have to install an admin Contribution. Recommended Contribution, which is compatible with the task manager:
http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,1174

Upto 5 Files will get modified, if you install everything (including the optional Tweak to index.php and the optional (but I feel neccessary) tweak to account.php).

ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THIS CONTRIBUTION:
NEW: Customer Tasks
With the New Task Manager, it is possible to assign a Project to a Customer (especially useful if you 
are offering Services to your Customers). As well, your Clients can log-in to thier Account and Review
thier Current Project(s) and task(s) statuses.

This hopefully will reduce the unidating emails and phone calls of "Where are you on my Project".

Recurring Tasks:
If the status has been assigned as such, will not be removed from the Task List.
They will continue to be listed until the status has been changed.
To Change a Task's Status from Recurring to a 'regular' status, you will need to use the "Review ALL Tasks" link (admin_tasks_all.php). 
 
UPDATES TO THE TASK MANAGER:
V. 2.00:
4-20-2006
- Fixed the Overdue Email sending procedure. If a Task is overdue, you will only get one email, not the continuous flooding that occurred in V 1.10 Variable was added to database to prevent flooding
4-17-2006
- Added Customer Select Drop Down to the "Add a New Project" box, enabling you to assign projects to a
Customer.
- Added Mods to account.php for the review of Customer Assigned Projects and Tasks.
- Added "View Tasks" by Click ing on Project name. (Similiar functionality to the Select By Drop-Down)

4-13-2006
Bug Fix: "Due Date" Calendar was not functioning as it should have, replaced Calendar with one that works.
Oversight: "Add Project" name field required a minimum of 5 Characters. Now only Requires 3.
OverSight: "Task Description" was taking up alot of space in the Task List, Truncated Text to 4 whole
words... 
A hearty Spiritual thanks to AirolG for noticing these issues, and aiding in debugging.

4-12-2006
- Added "Direct Edit" - Clicking on Icon Next to Task, Task name or Task Description takes you to the Edit Screen
- Added Task Manager Productivity Report: Review the productivity of your Assignees, and deable to print this report for review
- Added "View Task By" dropdowns. View Task By Status OR By Project
  (at the moment, it is one or the other, not both. Perhaps in a Future Build)
4-11-2006
- Added Column Sorting to Project List View and to Task List View
- Added Task Status to Adding a New Task
- Added Task Due Date to Adding New Task
- Added Task Due Date to Editting Task
- Added Due date to Task List View
- Added "New Task" Email - Sends Email to Assigned Admin.
- Added "Editted Task" Email - Sends Email to Assigned Admin when a task has been editted.
- Added "Over-Due Task" Email - Sends Email to Assigned Admin when a task is over-due.
(was later removed for flooding)

- Fixed Error in SQL File from V 1.10: Thanks to Airolg for noticing that

V. 1.10:
4-7-2006
- valeeum reported the when using ' in a Project Name an SQL Error Occurred.
This has been Fixed.

- Recurring Tasks have been added to the database table "admin_tasks_statuses"
		- Daily Recurring Task
		- Weekly Recurring Task
        - Monthly Recurring Task
- When editting a recurring task through the Task Manager, the Recurring Task Status Cannot Be changed. (Editting through admin_tasks.php)
- When editting a task through the Completed Task Manager (aka admin_tasks_all.php) Recurring Tasks can be changed to have regular Statuses
- Included 3 missing Button Images to Package. Thanks Gang!
- Updated the box task_manager.php to include a link to the Completed Task Screen

- I have also included a nice little tweak to index.php (Step 5 of the Install)

SPECIAL THANKS GOES OUT TO:
Airolg, Oihun, and Valeeum for thier feedback, Support, and List of Features to add to the Task Manager. I might be able to take credit for making the Task Manager, but those are the people who get Credit for making the Task Manager Better!

You Guys Rock!

Extra Special Thanks goes to Airolg for aiding in the debugging of the Task Manager 2.0

IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION:
1 - Unzip the task_man_002.zip

2 - Run the upgrade_sql.sql file in this contribution.
This installs changes made to the database tables. It is merely adding a few more rows, to a couple of
tables!

3.0 - Edit Lines 74 - 105 to edit your New Task Email Message.
3.1 - Edit Lines 122-153 to edit your Editted Task Email Message.
(These may Very Well become Variables in a Language File)
4 - Add the Follwing lines to filenames.php :

define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS_COMP', 'admin_tasks_complete.php'); 
define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS_REP', 'admin_tasks_report.php'); 
(Try to put this with your other defines for the task Manager)

5 - Upload all the included files.
Upgrade Complete

NOTE: You will notice two javascript files in the admin/includes/ folder. As much as I like SpiffyCal,
it doesn't always seem to work correctly, so I included popcal by Xin. This is one Calendar I feel should be used instead of spiffycal. But that's my Preference.


TO INSTALL THE TASK MANAGER CONTRIBUTION:

1- Unzip the task_man_001.zip

2- In PHPmyAdmin or another MySQL editor run the task_manager.sql file.
   This will install the neccessary database tables into your database.

3- Upload the included files to your admin directory.
   admin/admin_tasks.php
   admin/admin_tasks_all.php
   admin/includes/boxes/task_manager.php
   admin/includes/languages/english/images/buttons/button_admin_project.gif
   admin/includes/languages/english/images/buttons/button_admin_projects.gif
   admin/includes/languages/english/images/buttons/button_admin_task.gif
   admin/includes/languages/english/admin_tasks.php
   images/status/1.gif
   images/status/2.gif
   images/status/3.gif
   images/status/4.gif
   images/status/5.gif
   images/status/6.gif
   images/status/7.gif
   images/status/8.gif
   images/status/9.gif
   images/status/10.gif
   images/status/11.gif
   images/status/12.gif
   images/status/13.gif
   images/status/14.gif 
4- FILES TO MODIFY:
admin/includes/filenames.php

Anywhere in the filenames.php add the following lines:

define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS', 'admin_tasks.php');
define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS_ALL', 'admin_tasks_all.php');  
define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS_COMP', 'admin_tasks_complete.php');  
define('FILENAME_ADMIN_TASKS_REP', 'admin_tasks_report.php'); 

admin/includes/database_tables.php

Anywhere in the database_tables.php add the following lines:
define('TABLE_ADMIN_TASKS', 'admin_tasks');
define('TABLE_ADMIN_PROJECTS', 'admin_projects');
define('TABLE_ADMIN_TASKS_PRIORITIES', 'admin_tasks_priorities');
define('TABLE_ADMIN_TASKS_STATUSES', 'admin_tasks_statuses');

admin/includes/column_left.php

Anywhere you want to box to appear, add the following code:
require(DIR_WS_BOXES . 'task_manager.php');


5 - A Cool Tweak to admin/index.php
This tweak is only if you want a user alerted upon thier login of any tasks that have been 
assigned to them. I've only Included this because I consider this to be an Option that than a neccessity. 

in admin/index.php
paste the follwing lines of code near the Header title call in index.php
<?php $admin_tasks_query = tep_db_query("select count(*) as count from " . TABLE_ADMIN_TASKS . " where admin_id='". $login_id."'");
    $admin_tasks = tep_db_fetch_array($admin_tasks_query);?>
						  &nbsp;<?php //echo $orders_pending['count'];
						  echo 'You currently have <a href="admin_tasks.php"><b>' . $admin_tasks['count'] . '</b></a> Tasks Assigned to you. Please <a href="admin_tasks.php">Click here to review your Tasks & Projects.</a>';
						  ?>

This will display a neat little message to the user.

6 - An Addition to account.php in your Store root:
After the line:
<?php
  }
?>

and Before:
      <tr>
        <td><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
