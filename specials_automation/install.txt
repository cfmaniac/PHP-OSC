Special Thanks goes to:
-Felix Scwartz: He made a contribution for adding a start date to OSC's Specials. Made it one less steop I had to do.
Thanks Felix!


NOTES ON THIS CONTRIBUTION:
This contribution is directly based off of Felix Shcwarts' "Specials Valid From" 
Contribution (http://www.oscommerce.com/community/contributions,2520) which is also included 
as part of this contribution. 

What it does is:
-Adds a Starting Date Range for a Product's Special (Felix's Contrib).
-Adds an Inline Table for Editting/Adding a Products Special from the Product Edit page 
in the admin.

INSTALLATION:
1- BACK your Files, BACKUP your database. We can never stress it enough.
BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP!!!!!

2- Alter your database (e.g. with PHPMyAdmin or command line) so that there is
a place to store the start date.
ALTER TABLE `specials` ADD `valid_from_date` DATETIME DEFAULT NULL;

3- Extremly fast installation

    If you didn't install a contribution that modified
    catalog/admin/specials.php, the specials.php language files in catalog/admin/includes/languages,
    catalog/admin/includes/javascript/calendarcode.js or catalog/includes/functions/specials.php
    you may simply copy the new admin directory (the one that is created after extracting the zip
    of this contribution) over the old one and replace changed files.

4 - Open your catalog/admin/categories.php
Open the included categories_php_additions.txt file and follow the instructions for modifying your 
categories.php file.
		
That's it. It is That Simple.		
Happy Specialing!
